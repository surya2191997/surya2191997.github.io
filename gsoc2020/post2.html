The past couples of week went into implementing the CNN3D and MaxPool 3D forward pass functions. As far as the abstract view is concerned, for 3D convolution, we basically have 4 input dim, 3 stride values, 3 padding values, and 4 filter dim. The difference between 3D and 2D convolution is that in 3D the filter/kernel can move in all the 3 dimensions. The result of applying a kernel on an inpu  at a specified 3D location is the sum of convolution of kernel with the input map at that location, for all input maps. So, the 4th dimension of the ouput would same as the the number of filters/kernels that we have. For 3D MaxPool layer, we take the max of all values within the krnel. Each input map gives exactly one ouput, which is basically the max value at each kernel location. So for 3D MaxPool, 4th output dimensin is same as the number of input maps. For implementation, input and weights are still 2D matrix, with the number of rows representing number of input maps/number of filters.
