		      My GSoC 2020 <a href="../data/proposal2020.pdf"> proposal</a> under CERN-HSF got accpeted, once again ! I decided to apply for GSoC again this year for a couple of reasons.. First, I really enjoyed working with TMVA last summer and was really motivated to make it awesome(r), by including more deep learning functions/operations. Second, in these COVID times I thought it's best to apply for something which can be done remotely during the summer, and as we all know, GSoC is one of the best remote interships out there ! So my project this year is to develop 3D Convolution and 3D MaxPool Operations in TMVA, for cpu as well as gpu. The good part about this year is that I am already familiar with the TMVA codebase, so I can start implementing 'my stuff' directly, and focus on what's challenging in my project, as I already know about the overall structure etc. I look forward to a challenging and fulfilling summer !   </p>
